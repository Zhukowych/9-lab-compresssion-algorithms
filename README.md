# Compressing algorithm implementation
**Bohdan Milian**: Huffman algorithm, LZW

**Maksym Zhuk**: LZ77, Deflate

We have implemented Huffmnan, LZW, LZ77 algorithms and used combination of Huffman and LZ77 to create Deflate.
Although implemented algorithms are not as fast and efficient as they must be in real life usages, they show 
the basic structure of that algorithms
